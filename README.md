This was a personal project I started in 2021, and have now abandonded. This *partial* repository is public so that potential employers can see a code sample. 100% of this code was written by me. Test scripts were not coded at the time I was developing this.

This is a Laravel Project written in PHP and jQuery. Blade files were used at the time, but plan was to switch to Vue. Stack was AWS Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, and Memcache, all loaded with Docker. Load balancers were used as well as Amazon's CICD framework. 

HACKERS:
Some secret keys are displayed in this code. Those keys are not functional. Please don't waste your time trying to hack this. This project was taken offline in 2022 and will not be finished.
